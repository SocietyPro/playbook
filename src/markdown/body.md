#PLAYBOOK


[TOC] 

## Hello 

You Work on the XP-Squad SocietyPro Development Team . This is your playbook. It details how you and your teammates try and run our software development project. And team and how we make our products together. It is a living document that you can edit in a private GitHub repo.  It's filled with things we've learned based on our own experience and study of others' experiences.

Some of Our Work IS very technical, but can be public, such as our encryption protocols or git policy. Look in our public https://Github.Com/SocietyPro/Playbook/guides/ GitHub repo folder for that kind of information.

# Productivity 

## Pomodoros 

We like to use a time boxing technique called Pomodoros.  A nice time boxing technique called pomodoros A Nice webapp timer we recommend is: http://tomatoi.st/mkni

Here is the technique in general:

1) Pick a task to do
1) Pick a task to do 
2) Start the timer with a 25 minute countdown Countdown 
3) Work on this task without interruptions
4) If you get an interruption, restart the timer interruptions 
4) If you Get an Interruption, restart the timer 
5) After the timer ends, mark an X next to the task
6) Force yourself to take a 5 minute break: go for walk, stretch, get mind off work.
7) Repeat 4 times. After the 4th pomodoro, take a forced 30 minute break.
