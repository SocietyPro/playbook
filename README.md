SocietyPro Developer Playbook

Hello

You work on SocietyPro. This is your playbook. It details how you and your teammates try and run our software development project. And how we make our products together. It is a living document that you can edit in a private GitHub repo.

It's filled with things we've learned based on our own experience and study of others' experiences.

Some of our work is very technical, but can be public, such as our encryption protocols or git policy. Look in our public https://githu.com/SocietyPro/Playbook/guides GitHub repo folder for that kind of information.



## Version Control

We always use source code control. It's like a time machine. We can work in parallel universes of our source code, experimenting without fear of losing work. Roll back if something goes wrong.

Git is an open source source code control system written by Linus Torvalds. It's fast and great for working in branches.

We use GitHub for hosting our git repositories.
